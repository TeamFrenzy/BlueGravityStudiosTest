  - O-oh, wow, I mean-
  - Fresh out of the shower, aren't you? Hahaha...
  - ...you aren't like a psycho or anything, aren't you?

  - Memory loss? I thought that was just a thing in movies.
  - You remember how to walk and talk but forgot to hide the Loch Ness monster? How

  - That's too selective even for me.
  - Anyway, why don't you buy some clothes?
